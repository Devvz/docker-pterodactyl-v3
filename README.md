# Pterodactyl Docker Containers

**V3**

This installation was designed to configure Pterodactyl using three separate Docker containers each individually running one of the major services required for the panel to function properly:

- Pterodactyl (PHP)  
- MySQL (MariaDB)  
- Web Server (NGINX)

These containers were built with CentOS 7.1 using PHP7.

**V4**

For the next version, I'd liek to reconfigure PHP to be on a completely separate server than Pterodactyl so that we can continue adding PHP servers to scale as necessary. It would also be beneficial to configure a Memcached server for additional caching.

## Overview

**docker-compose.yml (creates containers for all services)**

**Dockerfile (configures the image within the container)**

## Deploy

- Move docker-compose.yml to a local directory on the host  
- Deploy the containers  
`docker-compose up` This reads the docker-compose.yml file which pulls the image location from Quay.io and then performs the operations within the yml file (creation of containers)










## Overview (OLD)

**Dockerfile (configures Pterodactyl/PHP image)**
- Installs PHP on image (this is actually a shared volume with the PHP and NGINX container)
- ~~Run the following commands during the PHP installation (Dockerfile):~~  
~~`ln -s /usr/bin/php70 /usr/bin/php`  
`ln -s /usr/bin/php70-phar /usr/bin/php-phar`  
*Log: 2016/12/22 - These symlinks are required to allow the `php` command to function, as it references `/usr/bin/php`. I have added them to the Dockerfile.*~~  
- Uploads the `/files` directory from GitHub to host (contains `/etc/supervisor/conf.d/pterodactyl-worker.conf/` for queue listeners and `/var/www/html/entrypoint.sh` for `php artisan` settings)
- Changes directory to extraction destination (`/apps/pterodactyl/`)
- Extracts Pterodactyl files to current directory on image (for panel installation)
- Installs Composer on image
- ~~Perform the `composer setup` command (Dockerfile)  
*Log: 2016/12/22 - We are already doing this using the `composer install --ansi --no-dev` command. This is the same command executed in a different way.*~~  
- `ENTRYPOINT` specifies location to `php artisan` environment configuration settings  
~~`php artisan pterodactyl:env`  
`php artisan pterodactyl:mail`  
`php artisan migrate`  
`php artisan db:seed`  
`php artisan pterodactyl:user`  
*Log: 2016/12/22 - Created entrypoint.sh and added this to the Dockerfile to configure the `php artisan` settings.*~~  

**docker-compose.yml (creates containers for all services)**
- Creates web container using NGINX
- Configures NGINX by copying configuration file from host (`/etc/nginx/sites-available/pterodactyl.conf`) (this file is modified to point to the php service on port 9000 instead of locally)
- Creates Pterodactyl container by pulling image we created in the Dockerfile from Quay.io (for the panel and PHP)
- Configures Pterodactyl container environment variables (db_env) and copies configuration file from host (`/etc/supervisor/conf.d/pterodactyl-worker.conf)
- ~~3) Queue listeners (Configuration File):  
`pterodactyl-worker.conf` in `/etc/supervisor/conf.d` directory  
`[program:pterodactyl-worker]
process_name=%(program_name)s_%(process_num)02d
command=php /var/www/pterodactyl/html/artisan queue:work database --sleep=3 --tries=3
autostart=true
autorestart=true
user=www-data
numprocs=2
redirect_stderr=true
stdout_logfile=/var/www/pterodactyl/html/storage/logs/queue-worker.log`  
*Log: 2016/12/22 - Added `- ./files/etc/supervisor/conf.d/pterodactyl-worker.conf/:/etc/supervisor/conf.d/pterodactyl-worker.conf` to docker-composer.yml*~~  
- Creates database container using MariaDB
- Configures database container environment variables (MYSQL_env)

**Missing Steps**

- Run the following commands during the Pterodactyl installation (docker-compose.yml):  
`chmod -R 777 storage/* bootstrap/cache`  
`chown -R www-data:www-data *`  
- 1) Queue listeners (Crontab):  
`crontab -e`  
`* * * * * php /var/www/pterodactyl/html/artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1`  
- 2) Queue listeners (Supervisor):  
`apt-get install supervisor`  
`service supervisor start`  
- 4) Queue listeners (Update Supervisor):  
`supervisorctl reread`  
`supervisorctl update`  
- 5) Queue listeners (Start Worker Queue):  
`supervisorctl start pterodactyl-worker:*`  
`systemctl enable supervisor`  
- Run the following to symlink the new configuration file into the sites-enabled folder  
`ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/pterodactyl.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/pterodactyl.conf`  
`systemctl restart nginx`  
*Log: This can be done via a symlink (somehow) or, alternatively, by simply copying the file into both directories in the `docker-compose.yml`*

## Questions

- Copying over the files is beginning to become confusing since we're copying the `./files/` directory to the host but we're also now installing Pterodactyl to a shared volume.
- How are we supposed to copy over the required files for the NGINX container? Right now we're using them in the `./files`/ directory but this really should just be for PHP.
- The volume specified in the `docker-compose.yml` for MariaDB `- ./dbdata:/var/lib/mysql`, what is this source and destination?
- Right now everything is using the shared volume at the top level. Can we make folders in the shared volume to separate the data?
